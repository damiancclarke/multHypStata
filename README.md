# multHypStata
Slides and code on multiple hypothesis testing corrections in Stata

These slides and code cover the materials discussed during the Stata Economic Symposium, 2021.  The details of the simulations presented in the slides and discussed in the code are contained in the file multHyp.do.  To replicate this code, it is sufficient to download both files contained here (the do file and the ado file), and run the do file from the folder containing the ado file.  No other changes should be necessary for replication.  Further information is contained in the header of multHyp.do.  

This code has been tested on Stata 14, though likely should work on earlier versions of Stata.
